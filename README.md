The sensors connected to the Arduino would send out statistical data using IoT protocols such as the MQTT. This data would be stored in our Firebase Cloud Firestore database which would be updated in realtime. We would then run our Machine Learning model to analyze the data and predict the likelihood of the area catching fire to prevent it. All this data would be tracked on our website for the citizens and the government of the country.
